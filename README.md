Born from a meme on the uni Discord server, is pretty much PUP. 

Use `jeleel_yeah.ps1` to install and `jeleel_nah.ps1` to remove. 

You may need to enable Powershell scripts by running `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` in an elevated Powershell prompt first 
(this can be reverted with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted`).
